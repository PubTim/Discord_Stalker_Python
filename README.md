# Discord_Stalker_Python
 
Note: This is currently UNDER DEVELOPMENT

This python bot is supposed to be able to pick a discord user, and when the user changes their activity, will log it down.

To set the target change the name to the username of the target and discriminator to the user's 4 digit ID.

Currently, the bot will display all activies changed by everyone on the server it is in, activites such as:

- Offline to online
- Playing a game
- Changing status

Future freature of logging this activity change down will come soon, plus probably also another way to read the target's messages on various channels and servers. 

P.S: discord intents must be enabled for the bot to work.
